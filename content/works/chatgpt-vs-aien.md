summary: Why our AI is different from ChatGPT and the other LLMs: it does not guess the next word, it runs real work, checks the results, and shows its receipts.

ChatGPT guesses. Ours proves.

ChatGPT is a word guesser. You ask it something, and it predicts which words should come next, based on patterns in everything it has read. It is shockingly good at sounding right. But it never runs anything, never tests anything, and never checks its own work. It cannot tell a true answer from a confident wrong one, because to it they are the same thing: likely words.

Ours works more like an engineer than a talker. When it gets a goal, it makes a plan, runs real experiments on real hardware, measures what actually happened, and checks the results before it believes them. If the plan fails, it figures out why and tries a new one, by itself. Every step leaves a receipt: what it tried, what it measured, what passed, what did not.

## The differences

**Proof, not performance.** ChatGPT performs an answer. Ours has to earn one. Nothing gets used until it passes a test with measured evidence behind it.

**It does things, not just says things.** ChatGPT cannot touch the real world. Ours runs on real hardware, uses real tools, and every action goes through a permission check with a full audit trail of what it did and why.

**It remembers.** ChatGPT starts every conversation from zero. Ours keeps a durable memory of what worked, what failed, and why, and that record is what it improves on.

**It lives on your machine, not theirs.** ChatGPT runs in someone else's data center, on their meter, under their rules. Ours runs on our own hardware. Nobody can switch it off, throttle it, or read what it is doing.

**It is honest about what it is not.** ChatGPT will confidently answer questions it cannot verify. Ours carries an explicit list of what it does not claim: no consciousness, no general intelligence, no pretending.

One line version: ChatGPT is the world's best guesser. Ours is a machine that does work, checks its work, and shows its receipts.

The measured evidence behind these claims is public: the [R13 living-system run](https://github.com/aien-dev/omega/pull/49) and the [R14 living-recovery run](https://github.com/aien-dev/omega/pull/50), each with a machine-readable execution receipt.
